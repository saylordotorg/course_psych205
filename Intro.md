*DISCLAIMER: This course is designed to address the fundamentals of
clinical psychology. It will <span
style="text-decoration: underline;">NOT</span> provide the education or
experience needed for the diagnosing and treating of mental disorders.*
This course will cover the basic concepts of clinical psychology, or the
study of diagnosing, treating, and understanding abnormal and
maladaptive behaviors. We frequently refer to these behaviors—which
include depression, anxiety, and schizophrenia—as mental diseases or
disorders. While you might have a general understanding of these
disorders, this course will cover each in great detail. Many of you are
likely familiar with the idea of therapy, whether because you or someone
you know has been in therapy, or because you have seen it in popular TV
shows or movies. Because many approaches to therapy draw from research
on *clinical* populations—that is, populations suffering from some sort
of mental disorder—therapy is closely related to the field of
psychopathology. Although this class will not teach you how to conduct
therapy—see [PSYCH404](http://www.saylor.org/courses/psych404/), or
Psychotherapy for an in-depth look at the subject—it will provide you
with a solid understanding of the etiology and symptoms of a number of
disorders. Much of the information in this course is based on the
*Diagnostic and Statistical Manual IV-TR* (DSM), the industry standard
for both clinical psychologists and psychiatrists who reference it
frequently in order to diagnose mental disorders. A new version of this
manual is due to be published soon, and it will likely challenge some
commonly held ideas about certain disorders. This brings up an important
point about clinical psychology: few issues in the field have
hard-and-fast answers. Much is left up to debate and subjective opinion.
As such, rather than providing you with step-by-step directions, this
course has been designed to provide you with in-depth, current
information about mental disease and related aspects. We will begin this
course by reviewing the historical context from which clinical
psychology emerged, and defining the major roles clinical psychologists
fill and the tasks in which they engage. We will then discuss current
paradigms and classification methods before learning about individual
disorders, their treatments, and common explanations concerning their
origins. We will conclude with an introduction to methods of
intervention.

### Learning Outcomes

    the contributions of this subspecialty fit into or relate to the

 Welcome to PSYCH205: Clinical Psychology. General information on the
course and its requirements can be found below.  
    
 **Primary Resources:** This course is composed of a range of free,
online materials. However, the course makes primary use of:  

-   University of Houston: Professor Edward Sheridan’s *[Lecture Series,
    Clinical
    Psychology](http://www.learnerstv.com/Free-Psychology-Video-lectures-ltv271-Page1.htm)*;
    and
-   The United States Department of Health and Human Services’
    *MentalHealth: A Report of the Surgeon General* (1999).

**Requirements for Completion:** In order to complete this course, you
will need to work through each unit and all of its assigned materials.
Pay special attention to Units 1 and 2, as these lay the groundwork for
understanding the more advanced, exploratory material presented in the
later units. You will also need to complete:  

-   The Final Exam

Note that you will only receive an official grade for the Final Exam.
However, in order to adequately prepare for this exam, you will need to
work through all of the materials in the course.  
    
 In order to pass this course, you will need to earn a 70% or higher on
the Final Exam. Your score on the exam will be tabulated following its
completion. If you do not pass the exam, you may take it again, after a
14-day wait period.  
    
 **Time Commitment:** This course should take you a total of **60.25**
**hours** to complete. Each unit includes a time advisory that lists the
amount of time you are expected to spend on each subunit. These
advisories are intended to help you plan your time accordingly. It might
be useful to take a look at these advisories and to determine how much
time you have over the next few weeks to complete each unit, and then to
set goals for yourself. For example, unit 1 should take 9.5 hours to
complete. Perhaps you can sit down with your calendar and decide to
complete subunit 1.1 (a total of 2.5 hours) on Monday night, half of
subunit 1.2 (a total of 3.5 hours) on Tuesday night, the rest of subunit
1.2 (a total of 3.5 hours) on Wednesday night, etc.
