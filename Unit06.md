**6.1.1 Complications and Comorbidities** <span id="6.1.1"></span> 
*There are many complications and comorbidities associated with mental
health in adults. Suicide (attempted and completed) is a major
complication of adult mood disorders, and anxiety, depression, substance
abuse, personality disorders, and medical illnesses (e.g., hypertension)
are major comorbidities.

**6.1.3 Etiology of Mood Disorders** <span id="6.1.3"></span> 
*The etiology of mood disorders is not thoroughly understood, but there
are several aspects that influence mental illness development.
Biological (e.g., abnormal neurotransmitter concentrations, monoamine
hypothesis), genetic (e.g., relational in heredity, environment,
values/beliefs), and psychosocial (e.g., stressful life events,
cognitive factors, temperament/personality, gender) factors all
influence adult mood disorder development.  
  
 Refer to the United States Department of Health and Human Services’
Mental Health: A Report of the Surgeon General (1999): “Chapter 4:
Adults and Mental Health,” pages 251–257 for additional information.*

**6.1.4 Treatment of Mood Disorders** <span id="6.1.4"></span> 
*The treatment of mood disorders is complex because it involves various
stages. These stages (i.e., acute, continuation, and maintenance) apply
to both pharmacotherapies and psychosocial therapies.  
  
 Refer to the United States Department of Health and Human Services’
Mental Health: A Report of the Surgeon General (1999): “Chapter 4:
Adults and Mental Health,” pages 257–261 for additional information.*

**6.1.5 Specific Treatments for Episodes of Depression and Mania** <span
id="6.1.5"></span> 
*Specific treatments for episodes of depression and mania target symptom
patterns rather than specific disorders. Regardless of the type of
treatment for depression and mania (i.e., pharmacotherapies or
psychosocial therapies), there are issues with service delivery, such as
insurance benefits or management strategies.

**6.2.1 Risk Factors for Suicide** <span id="6.2.1"></span> 
*Suicide risk factors vary with age, ethnicity, family history of mental
disorders/substance abuse, and family violence, as well as additional
aspects. These factors can occur in combination and also change over
time. Research evidence has indicated that a change in neurotransmitter
levels (e.g., serotonin) is a risk for suicide.  
  
 Refer to the National Institute on Mental Health’s “Suicide in the US:
Statistics and Prevention” article for additional information.*

**6.2.2 Suicide in Different Groups** <span id="6.2.2"></span> 
*Suicide risks are different for different groups of people. Comparing
women and men, men are at a higher risk for suicide. Suicide in
children/young people is also different depending upon age (e.g., young
adults ages 20–24 are more likely to commit suicide than
adolescents ages 15–19). Older adults are also likely to die by suicide,
although this measurement is disproportionate to the national average.
There are also significant differences in suicide risk among
ethnicities.  
  
 Refer to the National Institute on Mental Health’s “Suicide in the US:
Statistics and Prevention” article for additional information.*

**6.2.3 Prevention and Treatment** <span id="6.2.3"></span> 
*Prevention of suicide should include treatment of major risk factors
(e.g., mental or substance abuse disorders) and psychotherapy should be
tailored to the individual. Pharmacotherapies should also be used to
treat risk factors, and improvement in primary-care providers’ ability
to recognize suicidal ideations should be emphasized.

**6.3.1 Conditions Associated with Depression** <span
id="6.3.1"></span> 
*There are many conditions in children and adolescents, such as anxiety
disorders, anti-social disorders, and substance abuse disorders, that
are associated with depression. These conditions, whether they occur
individually or in combination, may indicate that depression is a
response to the associated disorder, and that can increase the risk of
suicide.  
  
 Refer to the United States Department of Health and Human Services’
Mental Health: A Report of the Surgeon General (1999): “Chapter 3:
Children and Mental Health,” pages 150–151 for additional information.*

**6.3.2 Prevalence** <span id="6.3.2"></span> 
*The prevalence of depression and associated conditions in children and
adolescents is variable and dependent on numerous factors, including
age, symptom presentation, ethnicity, and gender.  
  
 Refer to the United States Department of Health and Human Services’
Mental Health: A Report of the Surgeon General (1999): “Chapter 3:
Children and Mental Health,” pages 151–152 for additional information.*

**6.3.3 Course and Natural History** <span id="6.3.3"></span> 
*The course and natural history of depression and suicide in children
and adolescents are influenced by age of onset and the effect of
progression to adulthood. There is also a high risk of these individuals
developing other mental disorders.  
  
 Refer to the United States Department of Health and Human Services’
Mental Health: A Report of the Surgeon General (1999): “Chapter 3:
Children and Mental Health,” pages 152–153 for additional information.*

**6.3.4 Causes** <span id="6.3.4"></span> 
*There are many speculated causes of childhood and adolescent
depression, but precise factors are not known. There is research
evidence that family/genetic factors, gender differences, biological
factors, cognitive factors, and risk factors for suicide/suicidal
behavior all contribute to depression development.  
  
 Refer to the United States Department of Health and Human Services’
Mental Health: A Report of the Surgeon General (1999): “Chapter 3:
Children and Mental Health,” pages 153–155 for additional information.*

**6.3.5 Consequences** <span id="6.3.5"></span> 
*The focus of both major depressive and dysthymic disorder is initial
personal distress (e.g., death in the family, bullying). This initial
distress can then lead to the impairment of many life aspects.  
  
 Refer to the United States Department of Health and Human Services’
Mental Health: A Report of the Surgeon General (1999): “Chapter 3:
Children and Mental Health,” pg. 155 for additional information.*

**6.3.6 Treatment** <span id="6.3.6"></span> 
*Various options are available for treating mental disorders in children
and adolescents. However, there are significant differences among
treating depression, bipolar disorder, and suicide in this age group
using pharmacological and psychosocial therapies.  
  
 Refer to the United States Department of Health and Human Services’
Mental Health: A Report of the Surgeon General (1999): “Chapter 3:

**6.4.1 Diagnosis** <span id="6.4.1"></span> 
*Depression in older adults often goes undiagnosed and untreated so it
is crucial to accurately differentiate between conditions such as major
and minor depression. It is also important to recognize that late onset
depression can manifest disparate clinical characteristics. There are
also prevalence and incidence patterns and issues with definitions and
procedures to consider when diagnosing depression in older adults.
Likewise, there are many barriers to diagnosing and treating depression
including the complexity of medical/psychosocial contexts. Depression in
older individuals should also be viewed across the lifespan in terms of
progression, recurrence, and remission, and somatic illness interactions
should be considered as reciprocal.  
  
 Refer to the United States Department of Health and Human Services’
Mental Health: A Report of the Surgeon General (1999): “Chapter 5: Older
Adults and Mental Health,” pages 346–350 for additional information.*

**6.4.2 Consequences** <span id="6.4.2"></span> 
*The consequences of depression in older adults include increased
mortality from suicide and somatic illness, as well as a large economic
burden due to various factors such as excess disability and frequent
visits to medical facilities for treatment.  
  
 Refer to the United States Department of Health and Human Services’
Mental Health: A Report of the Surgeon General (1999): “Chapter 5: Older
Adults and Mental Health,” pages 350–351 for additional information.*

**6.4.3 Etiology** <span id="6.4.3"></span> 
*The etiology of depression in older individuals is not fully
understood, but biological and psychosocial factors, in addition to
other risk factors such as persistent insomnia, grief, or
structural/neuroanatomical abnormalities, influence development of the
disorder.  
  
 Refer to the United States Department of Health and Human Services’
Mental Health: A Report of the Surgeon General (1999): “Chapter 5: Older
Adults and Mental Health,” pg. 351 for additional information.*

**6.4.4 Treatment** <span id="6.4.4"></span> 
*Numerous treatments are available to assist older adults in dealing
with depression. Pharmacological therapies (e.g., tricyclics, SSRIs,
multimodal therapy), electroconvulsive therapy, and psychosocial
therapies (e.g., cognitive behavioral, problem solving, interpersonal,
psychodynamic, and reminiscence) are all valid treatments for depression
in the aging population.
