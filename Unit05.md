**Unit 5: Anxiety Disorders** <span id="5"></span> 
*Now that you have a broad understanding of the whats and hows of
clinical psychology and mental health treatment, this unit will discuss
the mental illnesses that clinical psychologists most commonly focus on
understanding and treating. Over the course of the next few units, you
will learn about some common disorders, their specifications, and their
treatments. In this unit, you will take a close look at anxiety
disorders. Anxiety can be a normal, natural, and appropriate reaction to
a stressful situation, but this sort of anxiety is not the anxiety
present in an anxiety disorder. An anxiety disorder often involves
anxiety that is either disproportionate to the situation at hand, or is
the result of an otherwise benign situation. In this unit, you will look
at different types of anxiety disorders and their respective behaviors,
etiologies, and treatments as they relate to specific populations across
the lifespan. First, this unit will address information regarding
anxiety disorders in adults. Second, the unit will address issues
specific to anxiety disorders in children. Finally, you will learn how
anxiety disorders are manifested and treated in older adults.*

**5.1.1 Diagnoses** <span id="5.1.1"></span> 
*Anxiety disorders are the most common occurring mental disorders in the
adult population. In order to better understand the various types of
anxiety disorders (i.e., panic attacks, panic disorder, agoraphobia,
specific phobias, social phobias, GAD, OCD, acute and PTSD), it is
necessary to understand each illness and symptom manifestation to
properly diagnose the correct disorder.  
  
 Refer to the United States Department of Health and Human Services’
Mental Health: A Report of the Surgeon General (1999): “Chapter 4:
Adults and Mental Health,” pages 233–237 for additional information, as
well as the related articles from the National Institute of Mental
Health on panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety
disorder, and obsessive-compulsive disorder, as well as Dr. Judd
Marmor’s article on “Anxiety and Worry as Aspects of Normal Behavior.”*

**5.1.2 Etiology of Anxiety Disorders** <span id="5.1.2"></span> 
*The etiology of anxiety disorders likely involves a combination of life
experiences, psychological traits, and genetic factors. Acute
stress reactions to anxiety and the physiological systems involve focus
on the fight or flight response. Likewise, there are new views on the
anatomical and biochemical bases of anxiety (e.g., HPA axis system,
internal/external triggers) and neurotransmitter alterations (complexity
of serotonin, norepinephrine, GABA, CRH, and cholecystokinin), in
addition to psychological views (i.e., differences between
psychoanalytic and psychodynamic theories, and behavioral and cognitive
theories).  
  
 Refer to the United States Department of Health and Human Services’

Health on panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety
disorder, and obsessive-compulsive disorder, and Dr. Judd Marmor’s

**5.1.3 Treatment of Anxiety Disorders** <span id="5.1.3"></span> 
*Anxiety disorders are treated with counseling/psychotherapy (e.g.,
cognitive-behavioral therapy), pharmacotherapy (e.g., benzodiazepines,
antidepressants, buspirone), or a combination of both (i.e., using
multimodal therapies and future implications in treatment).

**5.2.1 Separation Anxiety Disorder** <span id="5.2.1"></span> 
*Separation anxiety disorder in children can develop through identified
and unidentified causes/risk factors, associated symptoms, and
manifestations. The prevalence and remission rates of this disorder are
high, and there may be a relational predisposition to panic disorder or
agoraphobia.  
  
 Refer to the United States Department of Health and Human Services’
Mental Health: A Report of the Surgeon General (1999): “Chapter 3:
Children and Mental Health,” pages 160–161 for additional information.*

**5.2.2 Generalized Anxiety Disorder** <span id="5.2.2"></span> 
*Children with generalized anxiety disorder worry excessively about
events and situations. This undue worry can lead to overly conforming
perfectionism or approval-seeking behavior.  
  
 Refer to the United States Department of Health and Human Services’
Mental Health: A Report of the Surgeon General (1999): “Chapter 3:
Children and Mental Health,” pg. 161 for additional information.*

**5.2.3 Social Phobia** <span id="5.2.3"></span> 
*Children with social phobia have a persistent fear of embarrassment in
social situations. Symptom manifestation may be difficult to determine
as young children may have trouble articulating their fears. There is a
lifetime prevalence of this disorder though it may become less severe or
completely remit.  
  
 Refer to the United States Department of Health and Human Services’
Mental Health: A Report of the Surgeon General (1999): “Chapter 3:
Children and Mental Health,” pages 161–162 for additional information.*

**5.2.4 Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder** <span id="5.2.4"></span> 
*Obsessive-compulsive disorder is characterized by repetitive behaviors
or obsessions that often attempt to displace obsessive thoughts. There
is a strong familial component of this disorder as noted by twin
studies, as well as evidence suggesting Pediatric Autoimmune
Neuropsychiatric Disorders Associated with Streptococcal infections
(PANDAS) affect development.  
  
 Refer to the United States Department of Health and Human Services’
Mental Health: A Report of the Surgeon General (1999): “Chapter 3:

*There is relatively little research on the efficacy of psychodynamic
and behavioral therapies in the treatment of anxiety in children.

**5.3.1 Prevalence of Anxiety** <span id="5.3.1"></span> 
*Older adults can experience various types of anxiety later in life.
Phobic anxiety disorders are more common during this phase and worry or
nervous tension (rather than specific anxiety syndromes) might be more
significant. There are several disorders (e.g., PTSD) that have been
less studied in the aging population.  
  
 Refer to the United States Department of Health and Human Services’
Mental Health: A Report of the Surgeon General (1999): “Chapter 5: Older
Adults and Mental Health,” pg. 364 for additional information.*

**5.3.2 Treatment of Anxiety** <span id="5.3.2"></span> 
*The treatment of anxiety in older adults can range in variability
including the use of pharmacotherapies. Benzodiazepines are used to
treat acute and chronic anxiety (although there is an issue with
toxicity) and buspirone is an anxiolytic that is comparable to that of
benzodiazepines in terms of efficacy.
