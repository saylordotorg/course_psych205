**Unit 7: Schizophrenia** <span id="7"></span> 
*Schizophrenia is among the most debilitating of mental diseases. It can
lead to sustained hallucinations and delusions, among other symptoms,
and ultimately cause an individual to lose all touch with reality.
People with this disorder are typically unable to maintain a normal
lifestyle without the assistance of both therapy and medical
intervention. The disorder is particularly painful because it often
develops during an individual’s late teens or early 20s, seemingly
robbing a life in its prime. Sadly, these individuals make up a
substantial portion of the nation’s homeless population, making it
almost impossible for them to receive appropriate help. Schizophrenics
often have a co-morbid problem with substance abuse, as they frequently
use drugs to self-medicate. This unit will discuss different types of
schizophrenia and their respective symptoms, etiologies, and
treatments.*

**7.1.1 Overview** <span id="7.1.1"></span> 
*Schizophrenia is categorized as a profound disruption in cognition and
emotion that affect fundamental human attributes (e.g., language,
thought, perception, affect, sense of self). The disorder is
characterized by a wide array of symptoms (including positive and
negative manifestations), and there are issues with diagnostic
complications and cultural variance that influence diagnosis and
development. Given these aspects, the prevalence of schizophrenia in the
general population can be skewed,  
  
 Refer to the United States Department of Health and Human Services’
Mental Health: A Report of the Surgeon General (1999): “Chapter 4:
Adults and Mental Health,” pages 269–273 and MTV’s True Life link “I
Have Schizophrenia” for additional information.*

**7.1.2 Course and Recovery** <span id="7.1.2"></span> 
*Studying the course of and recovery from schizophrenia is difficult due
to various complications, such as the changing natures of diagnosis,
treatment, and social norms. There is also variability in disorder
progression and recovery due to multiple influences (e.g., disease
heterogeneity, biological/genetic vulnerability, neurocognitive
impairments, personal/social issues). However, even with variability, it
is possible to generalize long-term course and recovery of schizophrenia
due to longitudinal research outcomes, and even gender and age of
onset.  
  
 Refer to the United States Department of Health and Human Services’
Mental Health: A Report of the Surgeon General (1999): “Chapter 4:
Adults and Mental Health,” pages 269–273 for additional information.*

**7.1.3 Etiology** <span id="7.1.3"></span> 
*As with other mental illnesses, a definitive cause of schizophrenia has
yet to be determined, but there are a number of factors that can
contribute to its development. Research indicates there may be an
interaction between genetic predisposition (endowment) and environmental
upheaval (disturbances during brain development). There is ample support
for both genetic (i.e., family, twin, adoption studies, brain anatomical
abnormalities, and abnormal levels of dopamine) and environmental (i.e.,
prenatal stressors, prenatal poverty, poor nutrition, and chronic
stresses) factors that influence schizophrenia development.  
  
 Refer to the United States Department of Health and Human Services’
Mental Health: A Report of the Surgeon General (1999): “Chapter 4:
Adults and Mental Health,” pages 276–279 for additional information.*

**7.1.4 Interventions/Treatments** <span id="7.1.4"></span> 
*Interventions/treatments for schizophrenia have advanced in recent
years, with service being linked to clinical phases of the disorder
(i.e., acute, stabilizing, maintenance, and recovery) and optimal
treatments including a combination of antipsychotic medications with
psychosocial interventions. There is also increased awareness of how
ethnicity and culture influence treatment  
 response so clinicians are utilizing ethnopsychopharmacology in
providing the best management of the disorder.  
  
 Refer to the United States Department of Health and Human Services’
Mental Health: A Report of the Surgeon General (1999): “Chapter 4:
Adults and Mental Health,” pages 279–285 and Drs. Kopelowicz, Liberman,

**7.2.1 Schizophrenia in Late Life** <span id="7.2.1"></span> 
*Schizophrenia can occur later in life although it is more commonly
thought of as an illness in young adulthood. The diagnostic criteria are
the same across the lifespan and there are noted similarities of the
disorder in younger and older adults, such as delusions, hallucinations,
disorganized speech, and disorganized behavior.  
  
 Refer to the United States Department of Health and Human Services’
Mental Health: A Report of the Surgeon General (1999): “Chapter 5: Older
Adults and Mental Health,” pg. 365 for additional information.*

**7.2.2 Prevalence and Cost** <span id="7.2.2"></span> 
*The prevalence and cost associated with schizophrenia in the aging
population focuses on prevention compared to the general population and
the high economic burden of the illness as related to other mental
disorders.  
  
 Refer to the United States Department of Health and Human Services’
Mental Health: A Report of the Surgeon General (1999): “Chapter 5: Older
Adults and Mental Health,” pages 365–366 for additional information.*

**7.2.3 Late-Onset** <span id="7.2.3"></span> 
*Individuals with late-onset schizophrenia exhibit some of the same
attributes (e.g., similar risks, clinical presentation, treatment
response and course) as those who developed the disorder earlier on in
life. However, there are significant gender differences in that women
are more likely to develop late-onset schizophrenia than are men.  
  
 Refer to the United States Department of Health and Human Services’
Mental Health: A Report of the Surgeon General (1999): “Chapter 5: Older
Adults and Mental Health,” pg. 366 for additional information.*

**7.2.4 Course and Recovery** <span id="7.2.4"></span> 
*While it is difficult to determine actual course and recovery of
individuals with schizophrenia, research suggests that early
interventions, especially with antipsychotics, result in better
long-term outcomes. It is important to consider studies by Kraepelin,
Eyler-Zorrilla et al., and Klapow et al. when determining course and
recovery of schizophrenia in the aging population.  
  
 Refer to the United States Department of Health and Human Services’
Mental Health: A Report of the Surgeon General (1999): “Chapter 5: Older
Adults and Mental Health,” pg. 366 for additional information.*

**7.2.5 Etiology** <span id="7.2.5"></span> 
*Etiological implications of late-onset schizophrenia include
neurodevelopmental (i.e., physical developmental defects), childhood
maladjustment, genetic contributions, and a possible neurobiological
subtype of schizophrenia. Various models (i.e., diathesis-stress and
multiple insult) also clarify etiological influences of the disorder.  
  
 Refer to the United States Department of Health and Human Services’
Mental Health: A Report of the Surgeon General (1999): “Chapter 5: Older
Adults and Mental Health,” pages 366–367 for additional information.*

**7.2.6 Treatment** <span id="7.2.6"></span> 
*Treatment of late-onset schizophrenia presents some challenges
including problems/barriers with pharmacotherapies, and compliance with
problem-solving therapy, interpersonal psychotherapy, and psychodynamic
therapy.
