**Unit 4: Related Subspecialties of Clinical Psychology** <span
id="4"></span> 
*The previous units addressed the general goals of clinical psychology:
to understand, prevent, and alleviate psychological distress and promote
psychological well-being. As this is a rather broad set of goals, and
there are a multitude of factors that contribute to the etiology,
prevention, and alleviation of distress, several subfields of clinical
psychology have emerged. These fields have made significant
contributions to our understanding of the complexities and nuances of
mental health and illness. In this unit, you will learn about the
various subdisciplines within the field of clinical psychology. Although
these sub-fields may be closely related to other disciplines, they fit
nicely into the study of human behavior as it relates to mental health
and illness, and they represent the cutting edgeof clinical science. You
will also take a look at child psychology, which is closely related to
the field of clinical psychology.*

**4.2.1 Theories of Development** <span id="4.2.1"></span> 
*Development is a lifelong process composed of a series of stages (i.e.,
functioning as an individual and with others/maturation). Various
theories of development, such as intellectual (i.e., Piaget’s stage
constructed theory) and behavioral (i.e., observation and measurement),
focus on how each affects childhood changes in self and the
environment.  
  
 Refer to The United States Department of Health and Human Services’
Mental Health: A Report of the Surgeon General (1999): “Chapter 3:
Children and Mental Health,” pages 123–125 for additional information.*

**4.2.2 Social and Language Development** <span id="4.2.2"></span> 
*Social and language development in children is influenced by a number
of factors, including the parent-child relationship (e.g., Bowlby’s
attachment), language origins (i.e., dependent upon both biological and
socio-environmental factors), and relationships with other children
(e.g., effects of peer relationships and development).  
  
 Refer to The United States Department of Health and Human Services’
Mental Health: A Report of the Surgeon General (1999): “Chapter 3:
Children and Mental Health,” pages 125–127 for additional information.*

**4.2.3 Temperament** <span id="4.2.3"></span> 
*Children are active participants in environmental input and the
importance of their involvement is reflected in their temperament (i.e.,
inherent/intrinsic traits affecting relationships and interactions).  
  
 Refer to the United States Department of Health and Human Services’
Mental Health: A Report of the Surgeon General (1999): “Chapter 3:
Children and Mental Health,” pg. 127 for additional information.*

**4.2.4 Developmental Psychopathology** <span id="4.2.4"></span> 
*There are various concepts and assumptions that affect our
understanding of children’s mental health and illness, including
developmental psychopathology. Childhood psychopathology arises from
complex, multi-layered interactions between numerous factors such as
biological, psychological, genetic, and environmental components, and
the manner or extent of those interactions over time.  
  
 Refer to the United States Department of Health and Human Services’
Mental Health: A Report of the Surgeon General (1999): “Chapter 3:
Children and Mental Health,” pages 127–128 for additional information.*

**4.3 Children and Mental Health: Risk factors, Prevention, and Mental
Disorders** <span id="4.3"></span> 
**4.3.1 Risk Factors** <span id="4.3.1"></span> 
*There are numerous biological and psychosocial risk factors that
increase a child’s susceptibility for mental disorder development.
Biological factors include family and genetics whereas psychosocial
factors include stressful life events, childhood maltreatment, and
peer/sibling influences. Furthermore, the interaction between the two
types of risk factors can greatly increase a child’s development of
mental disorders.  
  
 Refer to The United States Department of Health and Human Services’
Mental Health: A Report of the Surgeon General (1999): “Chapter 3:
Children and Mental Health,” pages 129–132 for additional information.*

**4.3.2 Prevention** <span id="4.3.2"></span> 
*Prevention of childhood mental disorder development
incorporates multiple aspects such as risk reduction, prevention of
onset, and early intervention. Numerous prevention programs and
strategies also contribute to the deterrence of mental disorder
development in children.              
  
 Refer to The United States Department of Health and Human Services’
Mental Health: A Report of the Surgeon General (1999): “Chapter 3:
Children and Mental Health,” pages 132–136 for additional information.*

**4.3.3 General Categories of Mental Disorders** <span
id="4.3.3"></span> 
*The conceptual framework of categorizing mental disorders includes
understanding how mental disorders unfold in not only children
and adolescents but also in adults, as biological, psychological, and
socio-environmental constructs change across the life span.  
  
 Refer to The United States Department of Health and Human Services’
Mental Health: A Report of the Surgeon General (1999): “Chapter 3:
Children and Mental Health,” pages 136–137 for additional information.*

**4.3.4 Assessment and Diagnosis** <span id="4.3.4"></span> 
*Assessment and diagnosis of mental disorders in children have several
primary objectives such as determining unique functional characteristics
of the individual and diagnosing signs/symptoms suggesting the presence
of a mental disorder.  
  
 Refer to the United States Department of Health and Human Services’
Mental Health: A Report of the Surgeon General (1999): “Chapter 3:
Children and Mental Health,” pages 137–138 for additional information.*

**4.3.5 Evaluation Process** <span id="4.3.5"></span> 
*The evaluation process of determining mental disorder affliction
includes gathering information from multiple sources, conducting
observations, and initiating additional testing/questioning.

**4.4.1 Normal Life-Cycle Tasks** <span id="4.4.1"></span> 
*Normal life-cycle tasks for the aging population indicate that a better
diet, physical fitness, and health care have improvedmental health in
the aging population. Chronic disability prevalence trends indicate a
decline in disability in the older population, but there is always some
disability associated with normal aging processes.  
  
 Refer to the United States Department of Health and Human Services’
Mental Health: A Report of the Surgeon General (1999): “Chapter 5: Older
Adults and Mental Health,” pages 335–337 for additional information.*

**4.4.2 Cognitive Capacity with Aging** <span id="4.4.2"></span> 
*Cognitive capacity with aging undergoes some loss, and there is
variability in not only the type of loss experienced (i.e.,
intelligence, language, learning, memory) but also in the causes (e.g.,
genetics, psychosocial factors, comorbidities). However, to mitigate the
effects of diminishing cognitive capacity, individuals can make active
decisions to avoid disease and disability, sustain high cognitive and
physical function, and engage in life.  
  
 Refer to the United States Department of Health and Human Services’
Mental Health: A Report of the Surgeon General (1999): “Chapter 5: Older
Adults and Mental Health,” pages 337–338 for additional information.*

**4.4.3 Change, Human Potential, and Creativity** <span
id="4.4.3"></span> 
*Research indicates there is a capacity for constructive change later in
life, and this capacity to change can even occur in the face of mental
illness. Older individuals who display flexibility in behavior or
attitudes can significantly decrease their chance for developing a
mental disorder. Though we all experience adversity and/or chronic
health problems, our potential for change can ensure good health is
retained through new social, psychological, educational, or recreational
pathways.  
  
 Refer to The United States Department of Health and Human Services’
Mental Health: A Report of the Surgeon General (1999): “Chapter 5: Older
Adults and Mental Health,” pages 338–339 for additional information.   
        *

**4.4.4 Coping with Loss and Bereavement** <span id="4.4.4"></span> 
*Many older adults experience multiple losses with aging (e.g., loss of
social status, self-esteem, physical capacities, family/friends due to
death). Coping mechanisms, whether informal (i.e., friends and family)
or formal (i.e., mental health professionals), can assist older
individuals in managing loss and bereavement.  
  
 Refer to the United States Department of Health and Human Services’
Mental Health: A Report of the Surgeon General (1999): “Chapter 5: Older
Adults and Mental Health,” pages 339–340 for additional information.*

**4.5 Older Adults and Mental Health: Assessment, Diagnosis, and
Treatment** <span id="4.5"></span> 
**4.5.1 Assessment and Diagnosis** <span id="4.5.1"></span> 
*Older adults experience many of the same mental disorders as younger
adults, but the prevalence, nature, and course of each illness can be
very different. Adequately assessing and diagnosing mental illness in
the aging population involves consideration of particular
characteristics including clinical presentation, high comorbidity with
other medical disorders, skewed symptom reporting, patient vs. provider
barriers, and stereotypes about normal aging.  
  
 Refer to the United States Department of Health and Human Services’
Mental Health: A Report of the Surgeon General (1999): “Chapter 5: Older
Adults and Mental Health,” pages 340–341 for additional information.*

**4.5.2 Prevention** <span id="4.5.2"></span> 
*Prevention of mental illness in the older population is important in
preserving health. Primary prevention (i.e., preventing a disease before
it occurs) can be applied to late-onset disorders, whereby
treatment-related prevention can impede relapse or recurrence of a
disorder. Likewise, excess disability prevention focuses on reducing
functional impairment, particularly in those with more severe and/or
persistent mental disorders, while premature institutionalization
prevention aims to delay the institutional placement of older
individuals until absolutely necessary.              
  
 Refer to the United States Department of Health and Human Services’
Mental Health: A Report of the Surgeon General (1999): “Chapter 5: Older
Adults and Mental Health,” pages 341–343 for additional information.*

**4.5.3 Treatment** <span id="4.5.3"></span> 
*Treatment of mental illness in the aging population includes multiple
components, each with issues related to treatment selection. Issues with
pharmacological interventions (e.g., side effects risk, polypharmacy,
treatment compliance) vs. psychosocial interventions (e.g., symptom
relief, health behavior promotion, new methods to service delivery)
should be considered when treating mental disorders in older
individuals.  
  
 Refer to the United States Department of Health and Human Services’
Mental Health: A Report of the Surgeon General (1999): “Chapter 5: Older
Adults and Mental Health,” pages 343–346 for additional information.*
