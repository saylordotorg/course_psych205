different types of psychotherapy treatments and begin to think
critically about the risks and benefits associated with each. *

**3.2.1 Psychoanalysis** <span id="3.2.1"></span> 
*Before Sigmund Freud was considered the psychoanalytic therapist,
several individuals developed the field as a precursor to Freud’s
thinking, including Franz Anton Mesmer, Philippe Pinel, and Jean-Martin
Charcot. These psychoanalytic predecessors not only influenced Freud
(i.e., conscious vs. unconscious mind, including id, ego, and superego),
but also influenced the teachings of Carl Jung (i.e., personal and
collective unconscious) and Alfred Adler (i.e., striving).  
  
 Refer to Professor George Boeree’s History of Psychology: “Part 4: The
1900s” pages 9–32 for additional information.*

**3.2.2 Behaviorism** <span id="3.2.2"></span> 
*Behaviorism focuses on what’s observable (i.e., the environment and
behavior) rather than what’s available to the individual (i.e.,
perceptions, thoughts, images, feelings). Several people have
contributed to this branch of psychotherapeutic treatments including
Ivan Pavlov (i.e., classical conditioning), Edward Thorndike (i.e.,
“puzzle boxes”), John Watson (i.e., “Little Albert” conditioning
experiment), William McDougall (i.e., “anti-Watson” stance), Clark Hull
(i.e., operationalization of variables), E.C. Tolman (i.e., cognitive
behaviorism), and B.F. Skinner (i.e., operant conditioning).  
  
 Refer to Professor George Boeree’s History of Psychology: “Part 4: The
1900s” pages 33–54 for additional information. *

**3.2.3 Gestalt Psychology** <span id="3.2.3"></span> 
*Gestalt psychology was founded by Max Wertheimer, whereby the focus was
on psychology as a “unified or meaningful whole.” Wertheimer’s protégés,
Wolfgang Kohler and Kurt Koffka, continued the Gestalt phenomenon that
includes several laws (i.e., pragnanz, closure, similarity) and
additional principles (i.e., figure-ground, insight learning, productive
thinking, isomorphism) describing the theoretical concepts behind the
psychology. Kurt Lewin’s topological theory and Kurt Goldstein’s
holistic view of brain function further contributed to the Gestalt
notion.  
  
 Refer to Professor George Boeree’s History of Psychology: “Part 4: The
1900s” pages 55–70 for additional information.*

**3.2.4 Phenomenological Existentialism** <span id="3.2.4"></span> 
*Phenomenological existentialism is a psychology that emphasizes our
creative processes more so than our adherence to laws. Franz Brentano
expounded on this notion using “intentionality or immanent objectivity.”
Other notable phenomenological existentialists include Carl Stumpf, who
focused on the psychology of music, Edmund Husserl, who investigating
the nature of the experience itself, Martin Heidegger, who discussed the
meaning of existence, and Jean-Paul Sartre who said “existence precedes
essence.”

**3.2.5 Modern Medicine and Physiology** <span id="3.2.5"></span> 
*Modern medicine and physiology focuses on numerous aspects of
progression related to the psychology field including technology and the
brain (e.g., CT scan, EEG, PET scan), pharmacological discoveries that
target individual neurotransmitters, genetics and genetic influences on
the human genome, and historical implications of lobotomies on
behavior.

1900s” pages 82–88 for additional information. *

**3.2.6 The Cognitive Movement** <span id="3.2.6"></span> 
*The cognitive movement came about in the latter half of the
20<sup>th</sup> century, influenced by the advent of the computer. This
movement had several advocates, such as Norbert Wiener, whose focus was
on cybernetics (i.e., “self-steering”), Alan Turing, who invented the
“Turing Machine” (or the first description of the modern computer and
its comparison to the workings of the human mind), Ludwig von
Bertalanffy, who created the “open system” (or a holistic epistemology
that allowed systems theory to be applied to multiple contexts), Noam
Chomsky, who specialized in linguistics and generative grammar, Jean
Piaget, who focused on the development of cognition/cognitive
psychology, Donald Hebb, who created a new version of “connectionism”
related to neurological theory and behavior, George Miller, who invented
“information chunks,” and Ulric Neisser, who vocally criticized the
cognitive psychology movement.  
  
 Refer to Professor George Boeree’s History of Psychology: “Part 4: The
1900s” pages 89–98 for additional information.*

**3.2.7 Future Directions in Clinical Psychological Theory** <span
id="3.2.7"></span> 
*Future directions in clinical psychology theory are progressing from
logical positivism (i.e., all knowledge is based on empirical
observation assisted by the use of logic and mathematics) to
postmodernism (i.e., there is no objective reality or ultimate truth we
have direct access to, rather truth is a matter of perspective or
point-of-view).
