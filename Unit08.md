**Unit 8: Age-related Disorders: Children and the Elderly** <span
id="8"></span> 
*Most disorders can arise at any time during a person’s lifetime, though
they may be statistically more common at one stage or another. However,
certain disorders only develop within specific age ranges, making age
diagnostically significant. This unit will take a look at individuals at
risk for age-related disorders at both ends of the age spectrum:
children and the elderly. You will learn about disorders frequently seen
in either childhood or late adulthood and identify their courses of
action, etiologies, and treatments.*

**8.1.1 Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder** <span
id="8.1.1"></span> 
*Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is characterized by
inattention and hyperactivity-impulsivity. These symptoms usually occur
together and onset of symptom presentationoccurs frequently and in
multiple settings. Prevalence of the disorder is difficult to determine
due to differences in diagnostic criteria, but it has been noted that
boys are more likely to develop ADHD than girls. Exact etiological
causes of ADHD are unknown although there are implications of
neurotransmitter deficits, genetics, prenatal complications, as well as
environmental exposure to toxins. Treatments for ADHD include
pharmacological therapies, such as psychostimulants, and psychosocial
therapies, as well as multimodal therapies. However, there are treatment
issues such as overprescribing of stimulants and safety concerns of
long-term stimulant use.

Children and Mental Health,” pages 142–150 for additional information.*

**8.1.2 Autism** <span id="8.1.2"></span> 
*Autism is the most prevalent developmental disorder in children.
Etiological causes are rooted in structural brain abnormalities, genetic
predisposition, and cognitive deficits in neural circuitry. Treatment
for autism focuses on promotion of social and language development,
applied behavioral methods, and antipsychotics.

Mental Health: A Report of the Surgeon General (1999): “Chapter 3:
Children and Mental Health,” pages 163–164 for additional information.*

**8.1.3 Disruptive Disorder** <span id="8.1.3"></span> 
*Disruptive disorders are a collection of behaviors rather than patterns
of mental dysfunction. There are several disorders that are classified
as a disruptive disorder, including opposition defiant disorder (ODD)
and conduct disorder. The etiology of these disorders is not fully
known, although there are implications that the cause may be a
combination of various biological and psychosocial components.
Psychosocial intervention is effective in treating disruptive disorder
but there is no consistent pharmacotherapy.

**8.1.4 Substance Use Disorders in Adolescents** <span
id="8.1.4"></span> 
*Causality or prediction of substance use disorders in adolescents is
not well known, but research indicates a significant co-occurrence of
alcohol and other substance use disorders with mental disorders.
Research also indicates that multi-systemic family therapies are an
effective treatment for substance use disorders.

**8.1.5 Eating Disorders** <span id="8.1.5"></span> 
*Eating disorders (e.g., anorexia nervosa, bulimia) typically arise
during adolescence, but there are age-of-onset and gender
differenceswith these mental disorders. Females are disproportionately
affected by eating disorders and age of onset is mid- to late-teens. The
etiology of eating disorders is not precisely known, but there are
implications that a combination of genetic, neurochemical,
psychodevelopmental, and sociocultural factors affect development.
Various psychotherapies and pharmacotherapies are used to treat eating
disorders.

**8.2.1 Assessment and Diagnosis** <span id="8.2.1"></span> 
*Assessment and diagnosis of Alzheimer’s is difficult due to the lack of
biological markers, subtle onset, and the need to exclude other dementia
causes. It is important to differentiate between mild cognitive
impairment (i.e., age-related cognitive decline) and the necessary
characteristics for Alzheimer’s diagnosis (e.g., memory impairment
combined with an additional impairment such as language or executive
functioning, and impairments in social and occupational functioning).
This disease is associated with a range of cognitive and behavioral
symptoms and the course of the disease implicates a gradual decline in
function over the course of the illness. The prevalence and incidence
rates of Alzheimer’s are significantly high (i.e., “graying of America),
and result in a high cost/economic burden for managing the disease.  
  
 Refer to the United States Department of Health and Human Services’
Mental Health: A Report of the Surgeon General (1999): “Chapter 5: Older
Adults and Mental Health,” pages 356–360 for additional information.*

**8.2.2 Etiology** <span id="8.2.2"></span> 
*The etiology of Alzheimer’s is not completely understood, but there are
indications that the disease results from a combination of genetic and
environmental aspects. More specifically, biological factors, such as
chromosomal mutations, plaques, and neuronal/synaptic losses, greatly
increase Alzheimer’s development.  
  
 Refer to the United States Department of Health and Human Services’
Mental Health: A Report of the Surgeon General (1999): “Chapter 5: Older
Adults and Mental Health,” pages 360–361 for additional information.*

**8.2.3 Protective Factors** <span id="8.2.3"></span> 
*While there are many suspected causes of Alzheimer’s, there are also
many protective factors that may delay disease onset. Factors such as
specific allele expression, use of certain medications (i.e.,
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and estrogen), interference of
histopathological changes (e.g., therapies to decrease plaque aggregates
or neuronal cell death), and understanding the role of acetylcholine (as
this neurotransmitter is implicated in Alzheimer’s pathogenesis), may
all contribute to delaying the progression or preventing the development
of the disease.  
  
 Refer to the United States Department of Health and Human Services’
Mental Health: A Report of the Surgeon General (1999): “Chapter 5: Older
Adults and Mental Health,” pages 361–362 for additional information.*

**8.2.4 Treatment** <span id="8.2.4"></span> 
*Pharmacological and psychosocial therapies are both used to treat
Alzheimer’s. Pharmacological therapies include acetylcholine inhibitors
and therapeutic medications for behavioral symptoms. Psychosocial
therapies include techniques used to preserve cognitive functioning and
assist patients and caregivers in managing the disease.
